      It’s important to take care when near a stranded dolphin or whale, as the tail is powerful and can cause injury. Gloves should also be worn when handling a living or dead animal.

      <p>

      If you think the whale or dolphin is dead call the hotline and let them know where you found the animal. To avoid disease, don’t have any contact with the dead animal without the right protective clothing, eg thick rubber gloves.
